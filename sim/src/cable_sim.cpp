// The simulator's half of the host link.
//
// A unit reads a desktop over USB CDC. There is no cable here, so this replays
// a capture instead: real bytes, written by the real Anchor adapter against
// its real panel config, taken with
//
//   node scripts/cardputer-session.ts --page anchor
//
// in the Anchor checkout. A hand typed approximation would be a fixture that
// agrees with whatever the view happens to draw, which is the one thing a
// fixture must never do. The session below is the Anchor page with the data
// service stopped, which is worth seeing on its own: every reading is a dash
// rather than a zero, because a zero is a reading and there is nothing to read.
//
// Anything the view sends is printed rather than dropped, so the key protocol
// can be read from a terminal with no unit attached.
